    ### Welcome to Our Tomato Disease Recognition System ð±

    An innovative solution tailored to address the critical challenges faced by farmers in Kenya. Agriculture is the backbone of Kenya's economy, and tomatoes are one of the most widely cultivated crops. However, the productivity of tomato farming is under constant threat due to devastating plant diseases, which lead to significant economic losses and food insecurity.

    #### Why This Matters
    Farmers often struggle with timely and accurate disease diagnosis, which is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Traditional methods of diagnosis are not only time-consuming but may also require expert knowledge, which is not always accessible to small-scale farmers. This web app harnesses the power of advanced machine learning and computer vision to bridge that gap, providing farmers with an easy-to-use tool for fast and accurate disease detection.

    #### Our Team ð©âð»ð¨âð»
    This project is a result of a collaborative effort between three dedicated team members and our esteemed supervisor. Together, we have combined expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and agricultural research to develop a system that is practical, user-friendly, and impactful.

    #### Our Mission ð
    By empowering farmers with cutting-edge technology, we aim to enhance tomato crop health, improve yields and contribute to the agricultural sustainability of Kenya. With this tool, we hope to make disease detection more accessible and actionable, ensuring a brighter future for Kenyan farmers and their communities.

    Thank you for being a part of this journey toward smarter, sustainable farming!
